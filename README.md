## Proposed Solution

The ChatBot for FAQ is built using [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com). The [KnowledgeBase](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/how/knowledge-bases) API is used to pass the ChatBot model with a library of FAQ's, based on which it generates the responses.

</p>

- The customer interacts with the Chatbot through the Customer-touchpoint website.
- The request received at the Customer-touchpoint website is then sent to our DialogFlow model, which generates a response
- The DialogFlow deployment has a webhook which calls back the address of our BI server, and the question asked to the chatbot is logged there in the database.
- The data can then be used by the **Sales and Service** team to get insights of what questions are asked by the cuesomers frequently and update the FAQ's in the chatbot deployment.
